# Connected Merchant Web Application #

The web application is built on the MEAN Stack. This project is built for the merchant and the travelers to communicate when they approach the store. This can allow them to see real time feedback from the information that is sent from the beacon to the traveler's mobile phone. It allows us to send and receive data from the telerik platform. It allows for communication with mobile devices and beacons. 

### Some of the functionality: ###
